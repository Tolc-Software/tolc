# Introduction

`tolc` is a tool that makes code written in `C++` callable from other languages. `tolc` reads the header files of a project and automatically generates the correct bindings.

`tolc` is easily integrated into any `C++` poject, either via the provided CMake Interface, or directly as a simple executable.

`tolc` is available on Windows, MacOS, and Debian flavours of Linux.
