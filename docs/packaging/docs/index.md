# Introduction

`tolc` is a tool that makes `C++` code reusable from other languages. It does so by reading the header files of a project and generating bindings.

`tolc` is easily integrable into any `C++` poject. It can be used from the provided `CMake` interface, or directly as a simple executable.

`tolc` is available on Windows, MacOS, and Debian flavours of Linux.
