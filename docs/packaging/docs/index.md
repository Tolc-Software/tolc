# Introduction #

`Tolc` aims to make it as simple as possible to use `C++` from other languages. `Tolc` does not require you to change any part of your existing `C++` but simply reads your headers and automatically generates the correct bindings.

`Tolc` is easily integrated into any `C++` project, either via the provided CMake Interface, or directly as a simple executable.

`Tolc` is available on Windows, MacOS, and Debian flavours of Linux.

* [WebAssembly](./webassembly/quickstart.md)
