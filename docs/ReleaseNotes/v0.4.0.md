## Output ##

* Renamed the bindings output file from `{library}.cpp` to `{library}_{language}.cpp`
  * This matches what the `target` is called in `CMake`
  * If you are using the `CMake` wrappers this is an internal change

* Vastly improved the readability of the `WebAssembly` bindings
  * Removed excessive whitespace when binding multiple namespaces
  * Fixed indentation when using public enums within classes


## Minor ##

* Removed `SYSTEM` when creating a `CPython` library with `pybind11` since it no longer has any effect

If you want to include `pybind11` as a system header then add the following *after* calling `tolc_create_bindings`:

```cmake
set_property(TARGET pybind11::pybind11 APPEND PROPERTY NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED)
```
