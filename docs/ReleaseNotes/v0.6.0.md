### Python ###

* Add support for transferring documentation from C++ namespaces to pybind11 modules

* Add support for the following operators:

| C++ operator      | Python operator       |
|:----------------- |:--------------------- |
| operator+         | \_\_add\_\_           |
| operator-         | \_\_sub\_\_           |
| operator*         | \_\_mul\_\_           |
| operator/         | \_\_truediv\_\_       |
| operator%         | \_\_mod\_\_           |
| operator+=        | \_\_iadd\_\_          |
| operator-=        | \_\_isub\_\_          |
| operator*=        | \_\_imul\_\_          |
| operator/=        | \_\_itruediv\_\_      |
| operator%=        | \_\_imod\_\_          |
| operator==        | \_\_eq\_\_            |
| operator!=        | \_\_ne\_\_            |
| operator>         | \_\_gt\_\_            |
| operator>=        | \_\_ge\_\_            |
| operator<         | \_\_lt\_\_            |
| operator<=        | \_\_ge\_\_            |
| operator[]        | \_\_getitem\_\_       |
| operator()        | \_\_call\_\_          |


Overloading is also supported. There are more extensive documentation in the examples section.

* Added support for polymorphic classes
  * Inherit from virtual C++ classes in python
  * Override virtual C++ member functions in python
  * Call functions via C++ base class on derived class from python

* Improve readability of generated output

### WebAssembly ###

* Added support for inheriting from C++ classes from javascript
* Automatic downcasting
* Improved documentation
* Improved readability of output somewhat
* Supports raw pointers when necessary
  * Trusts the C++ side to know when to deallocate

## Minor ##

* Improve accessibility of documentation site on mobile
